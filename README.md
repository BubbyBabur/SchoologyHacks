# SchoologyHacks

Schoology is a bad version of Social Media sites like Instagram and Facebook. However, it has **LOTS** of security issues.

When you post something, it seems like you can only post images and links. This is because you cannot manually put in other elements like iframe and script and whatnot. Instead, you must use the console.
