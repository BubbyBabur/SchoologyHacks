# Schoology Hacks

Have you ever been unsatisfied with *your* Schoology profile? Tired of not being able to put rick rolls for all your classmates to see? Ever not *not* **not** ***not*** wanted to put Schoology inside Schoology? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, or if the answer to any of these questions is no, or if the answer to any of these questions is indeterminate, then this is the right place for you!

So what is Schoology Hacks? Well, it's a way to put websites, specifically iframes inside you Schoology posts. And it's simple as one line of code:
`document.head.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src = 'https://bubbybabur.github.io/SchoologyHacks/addiframe.js'`
Go to your profile posts or any group on Schoology and open the console. Then, just put this line of code in but wait, before you do that:

**Make sure to go to the file https://github.com/BubbyBabur/SchoologyHacks/blob/master/addiframe.js. *MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT DOES,*** because I could've totally put something in there than sends all your personal info to my own server or something. Rule of thumb, don't do anything that you don't understand because rip personal info.

So yeah, put whatever in your Schoology posts. Need some suggestions? Maybe put https://bubbybabur.github.io/SchoologyHacks/rickroll/ in. It's, uh, ok yes it's a rickroll. Rickroll your teachers, whatever.

I'm not responsible if you get yourself into trouble ok? ok understand understood.
