# Schoology Hacks

Have you ever been unsatisfied with *your* Schoology profile? Tired of not being able to put rick rolls for all your classmates to see? Ever not *not* **not** ***not*** wanted to lock down your Schoology profile with an insecure password? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, or if the answer to any of these questions is no, or if the answer to any of these questions is indeterminate, then this is the right place for you!

So what is Schoology Hacks? Well, it's a way to put websites, specifically iframes inside you Schoology posts. And it's simple as one line of code:
`document.head.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src = 'https://bubbybabur.github.io/SchoologyHacks/addiframe.js'`
Go to your profile posts or any group on Schoology and open the console. (This doesn't work for comments, you have to be posting.) Then, just put this line of code in but wait, before you do that:

**Make sure to go to the file https://github.com/BubbyBabur/SchoologyHacks/blob/master/addiframe.js. *MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT DOES,*** because I could've totally put something in there than sends all your personal info to my own server or something. Rule of thumb, don't do anything that you don't understand because rip personal info.

Also, you can lock down any page or group with a janky password. This password can be found with some JS knowledge, but for the average user, it's rather difficult to find. Open a group or your profile, and put in your console: 
`document.head.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src = 'https://bubbybabur.github.io/SchoologyHacks/addlock.js'`
**Again, go to https://github.com/BubbyBabur/SchoologyHacks/blob/master/addlock.js to verify the code! Be careful!**

So yeah, put whatever in your Schoology posts, lock down your content, so yeah. Need some suggestions? Maybe put https://bubbybabur.github.io/SchoologyHacks/rickroll/ in. It's, uh, ok yes it's a rickroll. Rickroll your teachers, whatever.

I'm not responsible if you get yourself into trouble ok? ok understand understood.
